# police_network

The main goal of this project is to help people 'report crimes quickly' without waiting to reach the police station.

#Project overview

In many cities, police stations are far from some areas.  
So when a crime happens, it takes time for police to reach the crime scene.  
This project solves that problem by allowing citizens to send a direct message to nearby police officers using this web app.  

#Purpose
-> Reduce the time for police to reach a crime scene.
-> Allow people to report crimes directly from anywhere.
-> No need to call helpline numbers like 101 â€” just send a message.
-> Help police respond faster by using location information.

#Features
-> User can log in and send crime report messages.
-> Each message includes sender, receiver, message text, and location.
-> Location can be auto-detected.
-> Police can view all messages and take action quickly.
