# police_network

The main goal of this project is to help people 'report crimes quickly' without waiting to reach the police station.

#Project overview

In many cities, police stations are far from some areas.  
So when a crime happens, it takes time for police to reach the crime scene.  
This project solves that problem by allowing citizens to send a direct message to nearby police officers using this web app.  

#Purpose
- Reduce the time for police to reach a crime scene.
- Allow people to report crimes directly from anywhere.
- No need to call helpline numbers like 101 â€” just send a message.
- Help police respond faster by using location information.

#Features
- Users can log in and send messages about crimes.
- Each message contains sender details, receiver details, message content, and location.
- Location can be detected automatically for accuracy.
- Police can view messages in real-time and take necessary actions.
- Users can also file FIRs(First Information Report) and track updates.
- Admin can manage police and thieves(Crimanals) information.
- Dashboard provides analysis of FIRs by type, status, and gender.
